Textual's email encoding based upon the implementation as available in PHP Markdown

Versions & Requirements
-----------------------
Textual follows the rolling release development model. Code in the master
branch should always considered to be stable. While code in the dev branch
should be considered unstable or sometimes even expiremental.

There are no versions as in the standard release development model but
snapshots. The master branch may be tagged ("snapshotted") at any point in
time when a significant point of development has been reached.

Snapshots are schemed as follows:
[current year, four digit].[index, zero based]

PHP >=5.4 is required to run the code.
